The duck will have random colors, except for a few cases:

    1. extremely low chance of duck being 'dark mode'
    2. extremely low chance of duck being 'light mode'
    3. medium chance of duck featuring strictly R or G or B colors
    4. normal rarity duck will have random colors -> maybe later i try implement some mathematical way of getting matching colors
